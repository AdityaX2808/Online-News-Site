                <p>At NEWS APP, we believe that journalism is not only about reporting on issues but also advocating for change. This is especially true when it comes to issues affecting marginalized communities on campus. <br> We recognized that to effect change, we had to go beyond reporting on these issues and actively advocate for solutions. To this end,<br> our team embarked on a mission to provide comprehensive coverage of issues affecting marginalized communities on campus.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Through in-depth reporting and interviews, we highlighted the struggles faced by these communities.</li>
                    <li>We emphasized the need for change.</li>

                    <li>The role of campus journalism in keeping students informed and engaged cannot be overstated.</li>
                    <li>With the proliferation of digital news sources, campus newspapers have had to up their game to remain relevant.</li>
                    <li>This was the challenge faced by NEWS APP, the campus newspaper of our institution.</li>
                    <li>Recognizing the need for innovation in campus journalism, NEWS APP embarked on a mission to transform the way students engage with news.</li>
                    <li>Our team of student journalists, armed with a passion for informative journalism, set out to create a platform that was both user-friendly and comprehensive in its coverage of campus issues.</li>
                    <li>The key to our approach was to create a digital platform that was easily accessible to students.</li>
                    <li>Through a mobile-responsive website and an app, we ensured that students could access our content from anywhere.</li>
                    <li>To ensure comprehensive news coverage, we also introduced a news digest, which summarized the most significant stories of the day, allowing students to stay informed even in the midst of a busy schedule.</li>
